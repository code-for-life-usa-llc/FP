    <p>DannyLux signs with Warner Music Latina and VPS Music will propel DannyLux’s signature corridos and melancholic sierreño music — that primarily went viral on TikTok — to the world.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>“I showed Pedro the beginning of ‘Jugaste y Sufri,’ because that’s all I had,” he says. “He said, ‘Yeah, bro, if you could finish that, that would be perfect.’ We recorded it the next month. It’s crazy how it went from covers to knowing that I actually have a song with them.”</h1>
    <p>“Jugaste y Sufri” married Eslabon Armado’s sierreño sound with DannyLux’s soft rock. Towards the end of last year, the duet went viral on TikTok. On Billboard’s reggaeton-filled Hot Latin Songs chart, the regional Mexican song reached No. 3. As the artist who actually penned the track, DannyLux also pulled ahead of Puerto Rican superstars Bad Bunny and Ozuna on the Latin Songwriters chart, topping the tally for eight consecutive weeks. DannyLux continues to wear his heart on his sleeve in Perdido En Ti. The album’s title roughly translates to “Lost In You.” Across the 10 new songs, he chronicles a relationship from a flirty beginning to a heartbreaking end. DannyLux pines for his lover’s return on the intoxicating “Infeliz.” In the Eagles-esque “Mil Razones,” he counts the ways that she has him wrapped around her finger. For the album’s stunning closer, “Para Ti<3,” he leans fully into his Spanish rock side.</p>

    <p>“When people think of corridos, people automatically think of people talking about drugs in their songs,” DannyLux says. “With my music, I feel like it’s just calmer. You can listen to it and just like be vibing to it. Even if it’s my sad songs, you can still be vibing to those.” “Pedro found me through TikTok,” DannyLux says. “I covered one of his songs. Randomly he texted me one day if I wanted to be on his next album. I was so excited. I was so happy that day. We went on a Facetime call and I showed him some of the songs that I had written. I show him the one that we did and he liked it. Like I just finished it that night and we recorded it at a studio.”</p>
