<h1> How Jenni Rivera Became Famous </h1>

<p> Rivera was introduced to music in 1992 when she recorded as a Father's Day present to her father; she made more recordings and signed to Capitol/EMI's Latin division. Her first album, "Somos Rivera" ("We Are Rivera"), was released in 1992.At the onset of her musical career, she was told many times she would not make it. At that time and still today, the genre known as regional Mexican music was and is dominated by men. In a 2011 interview with Billboard magazine, she stated, "It was hard knocking on those doors to get my music played. One radio programmer in L.A., the meanest son of a bitch in the world, threw my CD in the trash right in my face." Those were the kind of issues Rivera faced as a female trying to crack the regional Mexican genre.She then released the albums La Maestra, Poco a Poco, Por Un Amor, La Chacalosa, and Adios a Selena independently, the latter a tribute album to Tejano music singer Selena, who was murdered in 1995.</p>
