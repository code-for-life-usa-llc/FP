                                                <h4 id="shadow">How Bachata Started</h4>
                                                 <ul>
                                                      <li>Bachata is a style of dance that originated in the Dominican Republic. It is danced widely all over the world but not identically. The basics to the dance are three-step with a Cuban hip motion, followed by a tap including a hip movement on the 4th beat. The knees should be slightly bent so the performer can sway the hips easier.</li>
                                                      <li>Bachata arose in the working class areas of the country. During the 1960s and early 1970s, it was seen as music of the lower class by the Dominican elites, when it was known as amargue music. The genre's popularity arose from the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the rhythm began to reach the mainstream media.</li>
